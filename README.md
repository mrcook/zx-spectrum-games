# ZX Spectrum Game Disassembly Collection

A collection of classic 1980's ZX Spectrum games, disassembled, annotated,
and provided here in the Skoolkit `.skool` format.

The disassemblies in this collection were either converted from the Skoolkit
HTML output back to the original `skool` format, or from plain Z80 assembly
files. Skoolkit is a great tool for aiding disassembly of Z80 based programs,
and in particular 8-bit computer games for the ZX Spectrum, making this a
useful source format to use.

In the decades since these games were created, many people have created
annotated disassemblies, however, many of those are no longer available, or at
best only available on the Internet Archive. This collection was created as a
central place to bring together these previous efforts while also providing
another, hopefully long living, archive.


## The Collection

_Ask forgiveness, not permission._ This collection is made from the excellent
work of other people. If you are one of these, and wish me to remove the
included disassembly, please let me know. My email is available in the `git log`.

## Additional Projects

* [JetPac](https://github.com/mrcook/jetpac-disassembly), in 2018 I created a
  fully annotated disassembly of this classic game.
* [The Lords of Midnight](https://github.com/mrcook/lords-of-midnight-disassembly), contains
  disassemblies of both the ZX Spectrum and DOS (1991) versions of the game.
* [Chuckie Egg](https://github.com/mrcook/chuckie-egg-disassembly), a very much incomplete
  disassembly I started after Jetpac, but still contains a lot of useful information.
* The creator of Skoolkit has made several excellent disassemblies including;
  [Skool Daze](https://github.com/skoolkid/skooldaze), [Back to Skool](https://github.com/skoolkid/backtoskool),
  [Manic Miner](https://github.com/skoolkid/manicminer), and [Jet Set Willy](https://github.com/skoolkid/jetsetwilly).
* [The Great Escape](https://github.com/dpt/The-Great-Escape), David Thomas has
  been working on this very complete disassembly for several years now.
* [Paul Maddern](https://github.com/pobtastic) has several Work In Progress disassemblies
  including; The Hobbit, Wheelie, PSSST, and The Way of the Exploding Fist.
* 3D [Deathchase](https://github.com/Ritchie333/deathchase) disassembled by Ritchie Swann.


## General Skoolkit Usage

Visit [Skoolkit](https://skoolkit.ca/) and read the docs.

You will need the original `.tzx` tape image (or `z80` snapshot) if you wish
to make further additions to the annotations.


## Code Editor Tools

If you're a **SublimeText** editor user, I've created syntax highlighting
plugins to make viewing `.skool` and `.asm` files a little nicer:

* [SkoolkitZ80](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SkoolkitZ80) syntax package.
* [Z80 Assembly](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Z80%20Assembly) syntax package.

Cheers,
Michael Cook
